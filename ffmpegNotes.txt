Transcoding: convert one streams (audio/video) from one CODEC to another
Transmuxing: converts from one format (container) to another one
Transrating: act of changing the bit rate or producing other renditions
Transizing: Act of converting from one resolution to another-used with transrating

process:
1: load media file into componenet alled AVFormatContext- only loads the header portion
then we can access the streams
ie can have audio and video - split the streams. each one will be available in component called AVStream
stream 1: audio encoded with aac codec
stream 2: video encoded with h264 (avc) codec
AVCodec will decode them into AVFrame and this will give uncompressed frame - same terminology/ process used in audio and video
