Notes from debugging:

add --verbose to show even more stuff
./PROJECT_NAME = run the code in terminal
hexdump -C /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/5.0.1/lib/libavformat.a | less

shows the bit content of the following file
use "q" to exit specific windows
can run specific error lines that you get in console in terminal to examine the error codes

split each line on the - character
"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/ld"
 -search_paths_first
  -syslibroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX12.3.sdk
   -o ffmpegBrewTest
   -L/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/5.0.1/lib
   -lavformat CMakeFiles/ffmpegBrewTest.dir/main.cpp.o
   -lc++
    -lSystem /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/13.1.6/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.osx.a

rm = to remove a file

-WL or LD = linker

to specify a library, linker adds either lib or -l to the name - you dont need to specify this

lipo -info /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/5.0.1/lib/libavformat.a
this is how you get the info of a file and how it is able to be run
man c++
can find how to manage c++ via the differnt commands
set | grep LIB- this is how you get the library path of the directory
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/5.0.1/lib
can change specific fies

can do enter a few times to add some lines

static and dynamic libraries - dynamic = can be changed

storage: c stored with __ before each library

cpp stored wtih _ before each library path - add certain characters to the end to specify function overloading
